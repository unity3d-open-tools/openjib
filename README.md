### What?
It's a simple camera path system using bezier curves. I am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project [The Vongott Chronicles](http://jeppezapp.com/vongott/)

### Why?
As with many other plugins in the asset store, the best ones are needlessly pricey. This plugin doesn't do much that the others don't, but it's simple and free.
